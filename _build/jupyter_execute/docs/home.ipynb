    "## inleiding\n",
    "In de wereld van Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) wordt succes bepaald door een combinatie van fysieke dominantie, technische vaardigheid en mentale hardheid (UFC, 2021). Vechters als Islam Makhachev, Jon Jones en Khabib hebben in recente jaren de UFC gedomineerd, niet alleen dankzij hun kracht of lengte, maar door een uitgebalanceerde beheersing van zowel strategie als mentale weerstand (Tapology, z.d.). De UFC – ’s werelds grootste MMA-organisatie – verzamelt al decennia uitgebreide statistieken over haar gevechten. Dit opent de deur voor data-gedreven analyse naar de kernvraag: wat maakt een UFC-vechter succesvol? \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "In dit project analyseren we ruim 6.000 gevechten uit twee Kaggle-datasets, waarin zowel fysieke kenmerken als technische prestaties van vechters gedocumenteerd zijn. Net als in andere topsporten maken we een onderscheid tussen lichamelijke (niet-trainbare) eigenschappen en technisch-prestatiegerichte (trainbare) vaardigheden. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Niet-trainbare kenmerken omvatten factoren zoals leeftijd, lichaamslengte en reach — eigenschappen die bij aanvang van een carrière grotendeels vastliggen. Trainbare vaardigheden daarentegen, zoals strike accuracy, takedown accuracy en submission attempts, weerspiegelen het resultaat van intensieve training en strategische keuzes. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Door deze factoren afzonderlijk en in samenhang te analyseren, en de data per gevecht én per gewichtsklasse te structureren, hopen we waardevolle inzichten te bieden voor coaches, analisten en vechters. De resultaten worden gepresenteerd aan de hand van statistieken, visualisaties en reflectie per perspectief. In de onderzoek wordt alleen gekeken naar de mannelijke vechters. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset preprocessing\n",
    "De analyse focust op twee hoofdtypen variabelen: \n",
    "\n",
    "Lichamelijke kenmerken: dingen die relatief vaststaan, zoals leeftijd, lengte en reach \n",
    "\n",
    "Trainbare prestatiekenmerken: dingen die beïnvloed kunnen worden door training, zoals strike accuracy, takedown accuracy en submission attempts \n",
    "\n",
    "We kijken dus hoe deze eigenschappen samenhangen met de uitkomst van een gevecht (wie wint). \n",
    "\n",
    "Om dit mogelijk te maken combineren we twee datasets van Kaggle: \n",
    "\n",
    "data.csv (Rajeevw, 2019): bevat gedetailleerde statistieken per vechter en per gevecht (zoals lengte, strike accuracy, etc.) \n",
    "\n",
    "ufc-master.csv (Mdabbert, 2021): bevat aanvullende informatie, zoals namen, odds en achtergrondgegevens van vechters \n",
    "\n",
    "Omdat geen van deze datasets volledig is, is het combineren ervan essentieel om een vollediger beeld te krijgen. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vorm \n",
    "\n",
    "1 – Inladen van de datasets \n",
    "\n",
    "De twee CSV-bestanden worden ingelezen als aparte pandas DataFrames (df1 en df2). \n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python \n",
    "\n",
    "KopiërenBewerken \n",
    "\n",
    "df1 = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\") \n",
    "\n",
    "df2 = pd.read_csv(\"ufc-master.csv\") \n",
    "```\n",
    "Deze twee DataFrames vormen de basis van het preprocessingproces. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2 – Harmoniseren van kolomnamen \n",
    "\n",
    "Om datasets te kunnen samenvoegen, moeten de kolommen die je gebruikt om te koppelen dezelfde naam hebben. \n",
    "\n",
    "In data.csv heten de kolommen met vechtersnamen: R_fighter en B_fighter \n",
    "\n",
    "In ufc-master.csv heten ze: RedFighter en BlueFighter \n",
    "\n",
    "Daarom hernoemen we de kolommen in df2: \n",
    "```sh\n",
    "\n",
    "df2 = df2.rename(columns={ \n",
    "\n",
    "    'RedFighter': 'R_fighter', \n",
    "\n",
    "    'BlueFighter': 'B_fighter' \n",
    "\n",
    "}) \n",
    "```\n",
    "Zo hebben beide datasets dezelfde naamgeving voor de vechters, wat noodzakelijk is voor de merge in de volgende stap. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3 – Combineren van de datasets \n",
    "\n",
    "We combineren beide datasets op de kolommen R_fighter en B_fighter met een inner join. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hierdoor blijven alleen de gevechten over die in beide datasets voorkomen, waardoor we meer complete gegevens per gevecht hebben. \n",
    "```sh\n",
    "\n",
    "df_merged = pd.merge(df1, df2, on=['R_fighter', 'B_fighter'], how='inner') \n",
    "```\n",
    "De datumkolom wordt genegeerd omdat die vaak ontbreekt of inconsistent is, en we analyseren vooral de eigenschappen van vechters – niet het tijdstip van het gevecht. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4 – Selecteren van relevante kolommen \n",
    "\n",
    "We selecteren alleen de kolommen die relevant zijn voor jouw analyse: \n",
    "\n",
    "Perspectief 1 – Lichamelijke kenmerken: \n",
    "\n",
    "Leeftijd (R_age, B_age) \n",
    "\n",
    "Lengte (R_Height_cms, B_Height_cms) \n",
    "\n",
    "Reach (R_Reach_cms, B_Reach_cms) \n",
    "\n",
    "Perspectief 2 – Trainbare eigenschappen: \n",
    "\n",
    "Strike accuracy (R_avg_SIG_STR_pct, B_avg_SIG_STR_pct) \n",
    "\n",
    "Takedown accuracy (R_avg_TD_pct, B_avg_TD_pct) \n",
    "\n",
    "Submission attempts (R_avg_SUB_ATT, B_avg_SUB_ATT) \n",
    "\n",
    "Daarnaast nemen we: \n",
    "\n",
    "weight_class: om te kunnen groeperen of filteren per gewichtsklasse \n",
    "\n",
    "Winner_x: de winnaar van het gevecht (uit df1) \n",
    "```sh\n",
    "\n",
    "relevant_columns = [...] \n",
    "\n",
    "df_clean = df_merged[relevant_columns].copy() \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5 – Schoonmaken van de data \n",
    "\n",
    "Om ruis en fouten in je analyse te vermijden: \n",
    "\n",
    "Verwijderen we rijen met onbekende of onduidelijke waarden zoals \"Unknown\", \"?\", \"unk\", enzovoort. \n",
    "\n",
    "Verwijderen we rijen met lege cellen (NaN) \n",
    "\n",
    "Sluiten we Catchweight-gevechten uit, omdat die buiten de normale gewichtsklassen vallen \n",
    "\n",
    "Verwijderen we vrouwelijke gewichtsklassen (zoals WomenFlyweight), zodat je dataset alleen mannelijke gevechten bevat \n",
    "\n",
    "Dit zorgt ervoor dat je alleen standaard man-tegen-man gevechten in reguliere gewichtsklassen overhoudt — dat is belangrijk om eerlijke vergelijkingen te maken. \n",
    "```sh\n",
    "\n",
    "df_clean = df_clean.replace([...], pd.NA).dropna() \n",
    "\n",
    "df_clean = df_clean[~df_clean['weight_class'].str.contains('Catch|Women', case=False, na=False)] \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6 – Toevoegen van verschilvariabelen \n",
    "\n",
    "We berekenen het verschil tussen de Red- en Blue-vechter voor elke variabele: \n",
    "\n",
    "age_diff: verschil in leeftijd (R - B) \n",
    "\n",
    "height_diff: verschil in lengte \n",
    "\n",
    "reach_diff: verschil in reach \n",
    "\n",
    "strike_acc_diff: verschil in strike accuracy \n",
    "\n",
    "td_acc_diff: verschil in takedown accuracy \n",
    "\n",
    "sub_att_diff: verschil in submission attempts \n",
    "\n",
    "Dit maakt het eenvoudiger om relaties te analyseren tussen verschillen in eigenschappen en de kans om te winnen. \n",
    "```sh\n",
    "\n",
    "df_clean['age_diff'] = df_clean['R_age'] - df_clean['B_age'] \n",
    "\n",
    "... \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7 – Opslaan van de opgeschoonde dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "De eindversie van je dataset wordt opgeslagen als een nieuwe CSV: \n",
    "```sh \n",
    "\n",
    "df_clean.to_csv(\"ufc_clean.csv\", index=False) \n",
    "```\n",
    "Je kunt dit bestand nu gebruiken voor verdere analyse in Python, Excel, Power BI of andere tools. \n",

    "If `conda` is installed, you should see a printed message with the version number.\n",
    "If you installed Jupyter Notebook before, it is highly likely that you already have anaconda on your machine.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using miniconda since it is light-weighted, and you can avoid waiting for a long time to install many packages that may not be necessary.\n",
    "If you already have the conda environment ready on your machine, you can skip this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Mac users, you can also install miniconda using the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager, as documented on [this page](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/miniconda):\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Install Jupyter Book\n",
    "<a name=\"s2\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, you will install the Jupyter Book package.\n",
    "Notice that there are two sections in this step.\n",

    "After you have the environment ready, activate it.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda activate jupyterbook\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, install the packages that are needed for building and compiling notebooks.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install -U jupyter-book\n",
    "```\n",
    "Check if Jupyter Book is installed correctly using the following command.\n",
    "Having no error messages means that Jupyter Book is installed correctly.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "jupyter-book --help\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Windows to install Jupyter Book\n",
    "Windows has a known problem that the conda installation for Jupyter Book can be pending forever.\n",
    "We have figured out a specific solution for this.\n",
    "You need to follow the exact ordering in this part.\n",
    "Missing any step or using the incorrect ordering can result in a forever-pending problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, open your Git Bash that comes with the git tool installation.\n",
    "If you do not know where to find your Git Bash, search it in the search bar near the Windows start button.\n",
    "Do not use the Window command prompt, as it is using a different command line system and will not work for our case.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open the terminal, you should see a `(base)` text in the terminal, such as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(base) abc@ABC-windows ~`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you did not see it, run the following:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "The above command should now brings you to the `(base)` environment in conda.\n",
    "If there is an error message, it is possible that your terminal does not recognize conda yet.\n",

    "After you have the environment ready, activate it.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda activate jupyterbook\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, install Jupyter Book using `conda install`. Do not use `pip install`, which will likely cause errors.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge jupyter-book\n",
    "```\n",
    "This installation may take several minutes, as conda needs to solve the environment.\n",
    "So please be patient and wait until it is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, check if Jupyter Book is installed correctly using the following command.\n",
    "Having no error messages means that Jupyter Book is installed correctly.\n",

    "<a name=\"s3\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to create a new repository to host your website and code using this tutorial as the template.\n",
    "Clone our tutorial repository (which downloads the code to your local machine):\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/yenchiah/jupyter-book-template\n",
    "```\n",
    "The cloned tutorial repository has the template files that you need to build your website.\n",
    "We are only using the template for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, go into the template folder and delete the old `git` history from the template since we do not need them. For Mac and Linux, run the following commands:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "cd jupyter-book-template\n",
    "rm -rf .git\n",
    "cd ..\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For Windows, we recommand using the bash terminal that comes with the git tool. If the above commands do not work, maybe you are running a different terminal system on Windows. Try the following commands instead if the above ones do not work.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "cd jupyter-book-template\n",
    "del .git\n",
    "cd ..\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To have your repository that can host your website and code, [create a new repository](https://github.com/new) and work from there.\n",
    "Make sure that your repository is public, and do not add a README file.\n",
    "You also do not need to add the `.gitignore` file and `license`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, clone your newly created (and currently empty) repository to your local machine.\n",
    "Remember to use the proper account user name (i.e., replacing `MY_USER_NAME`) and repository name (i.e., replacing `MY_REPOSITORY_NAME`) in the URL that you want to clone.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Below is one example of the URL\n",
    "# https://github.com/abc/example-repo\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, copy all the template files and folders from the tutorial repository to this newly created repository.\n",
    "Again, remember to use the correct repository name (i.e., replacing `MY_REPOSITORY_NAME` to your repository name).\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "cp -r jupyter-book-template/* MY_REPOSITORY_NAME/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{warning}\n",
    "Notice that you need to use a terminal to copy all the files (but not drag/drop or copy/paste files with the user interface).\n",
    "Otherwise, you will fail to copy the hidden files, such as the `.gitignore` or `.gitmodules` files.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Build the book locally\n",
    "<a name=\"s4\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are going to compile and build your book on your local machine.\n",
    "Inside your conda environment, we need to install some required Python packages:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install -U numpy\n",
    "pip install -U plotly\n",
    "pip install -U pandas\n",
    "pip install -U matplotlib\n",
    "pip install -U seaborn\n",
    "```\n",
    "To build the book, run the following command.\n",
    "Remember that you must go to the repository folder  (i.e., replacing `MY_REPOSITORY_NAME`) that you just cloned.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "cd MY_REPOSITORY_NAME\n",
    "jupyter-book build .\n",
    "```\n",
    "The above command only builds the newly-updated files since the last time you built the book.\n",
    "Sometimes you may want to build the entire book from scratch, and you can use the following:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "jupyter-book build --all .\n",
    "```\n",
    "After building the book, all the html files in the `_build/html/` directory will be updated.\n",
    "You can then use your browser to open the files locally on your machine to view the compiled notebooks and markdown files.\n",
    "You can also install a [local Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/) to view the files since the html files are sometimes incorrectly displayed if opened using a browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also already set up the configuration file `_config.yml` and the table of content file `_toc.yml` for you.\n",
    "You need to edit the `_config.yml` file to make it suitable for your use case.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Deploy the book online\n",
    "<a name=\"s5\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we have the compiled website files ready, and we can move on to deploy the website.\n",
    "We will do this using the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, go to the repository folder on your computer and use `git add` to indicate that you want to push these files to the remote GitHub repository.\n",
    "Replace `MY_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your repository name.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "cd MY_REPOSITORY_NAME\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "```\n",
    "Run the following to check if you add the files.\n",
    "You should see green marked messages in the terminal.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, commit the changes that you want to make using a message.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git commit -m \"Add my first book!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Next, push your code and files on your local machine to your remote repository.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git push\n",
    "```\n",
    "The above commands push your code to the main branch.\n",
    "Remember to enter your personal access token (not password) when asked to do so.\n",
    "If you use the SSH key authentication method, it will not ask you to enter the personal access token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to use the [ghp-import](https://github.com/c-w/ghp-import) package to push your website code to a separate branch.\n",
    "To use the package, run the following to install it:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "# For Mac and Linux users\n",
    "pip install -U ghp-import\n",
    "\n",
    "# For Windows users\n",
    "conda install -c conda-forge ghp-import\n",

    "Then, run the following command to push your html files to the `gh-pages` branch.\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, go to the URL that points to your GitHub repository, click \"Settings\" -> \"Pages\" to go to the page settings.\n",
    "You should see a message similar to \"Your site is live at [XXX]\", where \"[XXX]\" is your website URL that is publicly accessible, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![github_page_url](images/github_page_url.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, sometimes it will take a while for GitHub to update your webpage content.\n",
    "You can check the \"Actions\" page to check the status.\n",
    "For example, here is the [Actions page for our tutorial repository](https://github.com/yenchiah/jupyter-book-template/actions).\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have the public URL for your website.\n",
    "More information about how to publish your book can be found on [this documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/publish.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Update the website content\n",
    "<a name=\"update\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing all the above steps, you should now have a remote repository on GitHub and a local repository on your computer.\n",
    "Your local repository should be a folder with the name that we asked you to rename (i.e., the `MY_REPOSITORY_NAME` in the previous steps).\n",
    "If you are still confused about why there are remote and local repositories, check the 15-minute Git tutorial video that is mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#pre).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you cannot find the location of the folder on your computer, find it using the search functionality on your computer's operating system.\n",
    "Use your repository name as the search keyword.\n",
    "For Windows users, there should be a search bar near the Windows start menu.\n",
    "For Mac users, there should be a magnifying glass icon at the top right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can start to work on your notebook or markdown files.\n",
    "We recommend that you start with the `notebook.ipynb` file and replace the content with your code and text.\n",
    "If you already have an existing notebook, you can replace the original `notebook.ipynb` file with your notebook and rename the file with `notebook.ipynb`.\n",

    "Q1: I get errors when running the `jupyter-book build` command. What should I do?\n",
    "- It is possible that your packages in the conda environment are too old. Try upgrading your conda environment and also the Python packages in the environment.\n",
    "- If there are still errors, create a new conda environment and use a different way to install Jupyter Book. For example, if you used `pip install`, try using `conda install` instead.\n",
    "- Check if you use some packages that you did not install in your `jupyterbook` conda environment. Install the missing packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: I get errors after running the `ghp-import` or `git push` commands after entering my personal access token. What should I do?\n",
    "- Check if your personal access token has expired on GitHub. You can create a new token and give it a longer expiration time.\n",
    "- Try to create a new personal access token on GitHub and give it the permissions/scopes of editing repositories. The token that you created may have the wrong permissions/scopes, so you cannot push changes to GitHub.\n",
    "- Check if there are messages in your terminal that tell you to do something. For example, you may be asked to add the URL to your repository by using `git remote add`. Or you may be asked to run a different `git push` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: My Jupyter Book installation is still pending forever after following step 2. What should I do?\n",
    "- Try using a different terminal for installation, such as the Anaconda command prompt.\n",
    "- Try closing the entire terminal program and re-run step 2 again. Do not skip any commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: I followed all the steps but my webpage does not have anything, or my webpage is not updated. What should I do?\n",
    "- Check if your repository has the (updated) content. You may fail to push the code correctly to the GitHub repository. You can check this by using `git status`, which should indicate that you have no pending changes.\n",
    "- Sometimes it will take a while for GitHub to update your page. Give it some time and check later. You can go to the \"Actions\" page in your GitHub repository to check the status.\n",
    "- Your browser may have an old cache that does not reflect new changes. Search online about how to clear your browser cache. After cleaning the cache, check the website again.\n"
